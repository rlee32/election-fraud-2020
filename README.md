## Platform / Publisher Bias

Certain platforms are starting to behave like publishers by censoring voices that do not align with a particular agenda. Such platforms enjoy the protections of Section 230, while acting in bad faith. Google, Youtube, Facebook, and Twitter use excuses such as blaming the algorithm or cherry-picking moral violations for what to any sensible person presented with a handful of anecdotes is clear, biased censorship.

### Google / Youtube

1. Dr. Robert Epstein found that Google reminded only liberally-profiled users to vote on the Google home page for four days.
